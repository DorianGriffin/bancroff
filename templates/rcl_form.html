    <p class="note">
      F-1 students are required to maintain full-time student status every semester they are in the United States. Graduate students need to complete a minimum of 9 hours to maintain their immigration status. Students may have additional hours that are academically required by their department or for a tuition waiver. Classes during the summer are optional unless it is the first semester at UH; then an F-1 student has to complete 6 hours (i.e. full-time for summer). The following form must be completed before dropping below full-time hours after start of classes. Note: Dropping below full-time hours may involve the loss of resident tuition and GTF.
